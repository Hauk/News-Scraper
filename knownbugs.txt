1. URL encoding fails: Current workaround is to catch all Uni-code errors.
Workaround to be found.

2. dbupdater.py is in a currently functioning state. It fails over when the XML
of the RSS feed is different to what it expects. I need to add more code where
multiple site structures are handled so the soup knows what to look for. Still a
WIP. 80% fixed.
